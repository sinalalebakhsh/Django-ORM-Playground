## Why this start is correct

This setup is intentionally chosen to be **professional, reproducible, and publish-ready**.

* **Isolated environment (pipenv)**
  All dependencies are installed in an isolated virtual environment. This prevents system-wide conflicts and makes the project portable.

* **Explicit Django version**
  The Django version is fixed and verifiable. Anyone cloning the repository can reproduce the same behavior.

* **Publishable & reproducible project**
  The project can be cloned, installed, and run using the same steps on any machine.

* **Clear onboarding path**
  Anyone reading the README or this file can follow the exact same steps and reach the same working state without guessing.
